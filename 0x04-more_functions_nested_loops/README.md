c - more functions, more nested loops

1 - write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)

2 -write a function that multiplies two integers.

3 - write a function thatprits the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4 - write a function that prints the numbers, 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5 - write a function that prints 10 times numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6 - write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7 - write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8 - write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9 - Fizz-Buzz - write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For the numbers which are both divisible by three and five print FizzBuzz.

10 - Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
